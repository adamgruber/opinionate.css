> An opinionated complement to [normalize.css][normalize]

## DEPRECATED AS OF MAY 2, 2017
Version 7 of normalize reverted the changes made in v6. Use that instead.


**NPM**

```sh
npm install --save opinionate.css
```

**Bower**

```sh
bower install --save opinionate-css
```

## Why?

[Normalize.css][normalize] is awesome. Unfortunately, as of version 6.0.0, some opinionated rules were removed. This package aims to restore those rules for anyone who wants to keep up with the latest changes but still needs/wants the opinionated rules.

*You still need to include [normalize.css][normalize] in your project. This only includes the rules that were removed.*
